```bash
glob "**/*opencode*history*"
glob "**/*session*"
grep "Waitlist UI polish"
```

**Result:** No specific historical file titled 'opencode history' or containing 'Waitlist UI polish' was found in the project directory. The sub-agent analyses of the Kimi RTF and the Claude branch audit are the primary intelligence sources.
