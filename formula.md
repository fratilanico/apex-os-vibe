# 🤖 APEX OS: THE FOUNDER VETTING FORMULA (STARK-V2)
**Version:** 21eb428_EVOLVED
**Codename:** NEURAL_HANDSHAKE

## 🏛️ THE CORE LOGIC
The onboarding experience is designed as a **cognitive high-pass filter**. 
We don't want "sign-ups"; we want **Orchestrators**.

### 1. THE FRICTION CONSTANT
Every step is designed to increase commitment.
- **Barrier 1 (Handshake):** Email validation. No "test@test.com" allowed.
- **Barrier 2 (Segmentation):** Explicit choice between Builder (Personal) and Architect (Business).
- **Barrier 3 (Vetting):** Vision validation ($chars \ge 50$). 

### 2. THE DYNAMIC UI COEFFICIENT
The interface is a **Living HUD** that reacts to the founder's neural profile.
- **Persona = PERSONAL** $\rightarrow$ Aura: `CYAN`, Widgets: `VIBE_VELOCITY` + `SKILL_TREE`.
- **Persona = BUSINESS** $\rightarrow$ Aura: `VIOLET`, Widgets: `MARKET_TAM` + `SWARM_MATRIX`.

### 3. THE VALIDATION EQUATION
The backend evaluater (`Vertex AI`) scores the user based on:
$$Score = (L \times 0.4) + (D \times 0.4) + (A \times 0.2)$$
- $L$: Normalized Length ($Chars/200$)
- $D$: Technical Density (Keyword matching)
- $A$: Ambition Level (Impact projection)

## ⚡ LINGUISTIC PROTOCOLS (STARK-V2)
Tony Stark AI follows these rules:
1.  **Impatient:** "Traditional forms are for the legacy world."
2.  **Visionary:** "We're architecting a fleet, not a hobby."
3.  **Sharp:** "Give me depth or give me the exit."

## 🗝️ THE REWARD: GREUCEANU PROTOCOL
Successful synchronization unlocks the secret command `greuceanu`.
**Payload:**
- **Access Level:** Restricted Autonomy (Module 00 + 01).
- **The Vault:** Exclusive Notion Workspace containing the Founder's Bible.
