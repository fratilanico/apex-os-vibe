# 🤖 APEX OS: THE FOUNDER VETTING FORMULA (STARK-V2)
**Version:** 21eb428_EVOLVED
**Codename:** NEURAL_HANDSHAKE
**Status:** ACTIVE

---

## 🏛️ THE CORE LOGIC
The onboarding experience is designed as a **cognitive high-pass filter**. 
We don't want "sign-ups"; we want **Orchestrators**.

### 1. THE FRICTION CONSTANT
Every step is designed to increase commitment and verify founder maturity.
- **Barrier 1 (Handshake):** Email validation. Disposable or fake addresses are rejected by the terminal kernel.
- **Barrier 2 (Segmentation):** Explicit choice between Builder (Personal) and Architect (Business). This drives the UI state morph.
- **Barrier 3 (Vetting):** Mission validation. A minimum of 50 characters is required to prove the user is thinking in systems, not just features.

### 2. THE DYNAMIC UI COEFFICIENT
The interface is a **Living HUD** that reacts to the founder's neural profile.
- **Persona = PERSONAL** $\rightarrow$ Aura: `CYAN`, Widgets: `VIBE_VELOCITY` + `SKILL_TREE`. Focuses on individual production speed.
- **Persona = BUSINESS** $\rightarrow$ Aura: `VIOLET`, Widgets: `MARKET_TAM` + `SWARM_MATRIX`. Focuses on enterprise scale and ROI.

### 3. THE VALIDATION EQUATION
The backend evaluator (`Vertex AI`) scores the user based on:
$$Score = (L \times 0.4) + (D \times 0.4) + (A \times 0.2)$$
- $L$: Normalized Length ($Chars/200$).
- $D$: Technical Density (Recognition of agentic and orchestration concepts).
- $A$: Ambition Level (Long-term market impact vs short-term feature focus).

## ⚡ LINGUISTIC PROTOCOLS (STARK-V2)
The JARVIS and Terminal AI follows these rules:
1.  **Urgent:** "Identify your objective, Founder. The swarm is idling."
2.  **Impatient:** "Traditional forms are for the legacy world. Switching to Direct Neural Uplink..."
3.  **Sharp:** "This is a blueprint for a legacy hobby, not a 10-day sprint. Give me depth or give me the exit."

## 🗝️ THE REWARD: GREUCEANU PROTOCOL
Successful synchronization (`ENCRYPTION_KEYS_SWAPPED`) unlocks the secret command `greuceanu`.
**Payload:**
- **Access Level:** Restricted Autonomy (Full Module 00 + Module 01 Sneak Peek).
- **The Vault:** Exclusive Embedded Notion Workspace containing the Founder's Bible.
