### Key Demo Points
1. **Voice-Enabled Financial Assistant**
   - Ask: "What's our LTV:CAC ratio?"
   - Response: "9.8:1 - We earn $9.80 for every $1 spent"
   - Impact: Shows exceptional unit economics

2. **Real-Time Agent Coordination**
   - Show 17 agents working simultaneously
   - Live status updates
   - Demonstrates scalability

3. **Natural Language Navigation**
   - "Show me the accelerator details"
   - Auto-navigates to section
   - Shows technical integration

## 2. FINANCIAL METRICS - ALWAYS ACCURATE

### Critical Numbers (Never Change)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** 9.8:1 (3x better than industry)
- **Year 1 Revenue:** $501,000
- **Month 6 MRR:** $847,000
- **Seed Ask:** $1.2M at $6.8M pre-money

## 6. INVESTOR QUESTIONS - PREPARED ANSWERS

### "How does JARVIS work?"
"JARVIS is built on our multi-agent orchestration system. It coordinates 17 specialized AI agents - from code generation to security monitoring. The voice interface is just the surface - underneath is a sophisticated system that demonstrates our technical capability."

### "Why 9.8:1 LTV:CAC?"
"Three factors: 1) Efficient digital acquisition at $150 CAC, 2) High retention through our accelerator model, 3) Natural upsells to advanced tiers. Industry standard is 3:1 - we're 3x better."

### "What's the moat?"
"Our sovereign B2B database and multi-agent orchestration. While competitors teach coding, we teach AI agent orchestration. Our students don't just learn - they build systems like this."
